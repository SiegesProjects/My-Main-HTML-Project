      <p style="text-align:center">SiegePVP was a minecraft server I used to own, and although it didnt work out so well as to be the top server on the charts, it was still fun to mess around with multiple plugins.</p>
    
<p style="text-align:center">Some things we used to screw around with are essentials,groupmanager, and DEFINITLY createyourownmenus, bunch of other plugins in there I cant list off the top of my head sadly. Some staff were (and these are my friends so common names) Luna, GPXavier, OscaritoBG, ImrL, and Sphinx (Kind of).</p>
